# Installation Instructions:
- Clone this repo
- Clone https://github.com/Sumobot1/data_science_toolkit
- Symlink or copy the data_science_toolkit into msci_446_stock_market_prediction
- Run either Jupyter Notebook, or Jupyter Lab
- Preprocessing: `Tweet Preprocessing Twint.ipynb`
- Data Analysis and Graphs: `EDA.ipynb`
- Models: `Modelling.ipynb`

## Things to Keep in Mind:
- The clustering in `EDA.ipynb` uses the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
  - After the graph is generated, the number of clusters will need to be chosen and inputted to get proper clusters
